## 📱 Post-Launch (First 24 Hours)

### LinkedIn Announcement:
```
New positioning. New focus. New chapter.

I'm no longer running a design agency.

I'm a Founder Systems & Brand Architect.

I've just launched Wolsten SprintOS™ — a proprietary operating system 
for transforming founder-led businesses in 7–14 days.

Most founders hit a ceiling where their brand and systems no longer 
reflect the business they're building. They need transformation, not iteration.

The old way: 
→ 3-6 months of back-and-forth
→ Endless revisions
→ £30k-50k agency retainers
→ Still doesn't feel right

Wolsten SprintOS™:
→ Proprietary 5-stage methodology
→ 7-14 day systematic transformation
→ Brand, website, systems rebuilt from the ground up
→ Built for scale, protected by trademark

This isn't a service. It's a framework.

Limited to 3 transformations per quarter.

If you're a founder ready to transform, let's talk.

```

### Outreach (First 10 DMs):
**Template:**
```
Hey [Name],

I just launched Wolsten SprintOS™ — a proprietary framework for 
founder-led business transformation.

Instead of 3-6 month agency engagements, it's a systematic 7-14 day 
methodology that rebuilds brand, website, and operating systems 
from the ground up.

I thought of [their company] — would love to show you the framework.

Worth a 15-min call?

Best,
Dan
